The Employee Management System (EMS) for a university is a
software application developed to automate and streamline the
management of university staff. This system facilitates the efficient
handling of employee-related data and processes such as record
management, leave management, payroll processing, and
performance evaluation. Developed using Python, the EMS ensures
that administrative tasks are performed accurately and promptly,
enhancing the overall productivity and operational efficiency of the
university's HR department.
